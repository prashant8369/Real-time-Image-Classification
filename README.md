# Real-time-Image-Classification
 The "Real-time Image Classification" project is a Python application that leverages pre-trained Keras models to perform real-time image classification using a webcam feed. 
Key Features:

Real-time Image Classification: Utilizes a pre-trained Keras model to classify objects, scenes, or patterns in real-time.
Webcam Integration: Captures live video feed from the webcam, enabling immediate image analysis.
Model Flexibility: Supports various pre-trained Keras models for image classification tasks.
User-friendly Interface: Displays the captured images along with corresponding classification results in a user-friendly window.
Easy to Use: Simple and intuitive interface, suitable for users with basic programming knowledge.
Potential Extensions:

Facial Recognition Integration: Extend the application to include facial recognition capabilities, enabling identification and verification of faces in real-time.
Custom Model Training: Allow users to train custom Keras models for specific image classification tasks.
GUI Enhancement: Improve the graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user interaction and experience.
Performance Optimization: Optimize the application for better speed and efficiency, especially when processing high-resolution images.
Technologies Used:

Python: Core programming language used for application development.
Keras: Deep learning library used for building and deploying neural networks.
OpenCV: Computer vision library used for webcam integration and image processing.
NumPy: Library used for numerical computations and array manipulations.
Usage:

Simply run the Python script, and the application will start capturing the webcam feed, providing real-time image classification results.
